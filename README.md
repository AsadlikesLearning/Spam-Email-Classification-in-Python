# 📧 Spam Email Classification

**Spam Email Classification** is a machine learning project aimed at filtering out spam emails. This project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques combined with machine learning algorithms to classify emails as spam or not spam. The primary models used are Naive Bayes and Decision Tree classifiers.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Spam emails are a common nuisance in today's digital communication. By classifying emails, this project helps in automating the process of identifying spam, thus contributing to better email filtering systems. The project involves:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing raw text data.
- **Feature Extraction**: Converting textual data into numerical features.
- **Feature Selection**: Selecting the most relevant features using statistical methods.
- **Model Training**: Implementing and evaluating classification models.
- **Model Comparison**: Assessing model performance based on accuracy and other metrics.

⚙️ Usage
To run the classification script:

bash
Copy code
python spam_email_classification.py
This command will:

Load and preprocess the email dataset.
Extract and select the most important features.
Train Naive Bayes and Decision Tree classifiers.
Evaluate and compare the performance of the models.
✨ Key Features
Text Preprocessing: Efficiently cleans and prepares email text data by removing noise, tokenizing, stemming, and filtering stopwords.
Feature Extraction: Utilizes CountVectorizer to transform text data into a bag-of-words model, making it suitable for machine learning.
Feature Selection: Implements chi-squared statistical tests to identify the most informative features for model training.
Model Training and Evaluation: Trains and evaluates models, providing a detailed comparison of their performance.
📊 Results and Evaluation
The script outputs:

Accuracy: The proportion of correctly classified emails.
Confusion Matrix: A summary of classification results.
Classification Report: Detailed performance metrics including precision, recall, and F1-score.
At the end, the script identifies and highlights the model with the best performance based on accuracy.

📈 Performance Summary
Naive Bayes: Known for its efficiency and simplicity, often performs well in text classification tasks.
Decision Tree (J48): Offers interpretability and handles non-linear relationships between features.
