## Overview

Spam email classification is an essential task in email filtering systems. This project preprocesses email data, extracts meaningful features, and applies machine learning models to classify the emails.

The following steps are carried out:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the text data.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Converting text data into numerical features using `CountVectorizer`.
3. **Feature Selection**: Selecting the most relevant features using the chi-squared test.
4. **Model Training**: Training Naive Bayes and Decision Tree classifiers.
5. **Evaluation**: Comparing the models' performance based on accuracy and other metrics.
